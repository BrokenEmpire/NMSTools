# NMSTools

A .Net Serialization/Deserialization framework for viewing No Man's Sky save games.  All properties are properly attributed with the obscured NMS key name and all classes inherit INotifyPropertyChanged for easy WPF/XMAL binding.

The framework uses Newtonsoft.Json for Json parsing.

Save file schema is based on No Man's Sky version 3.13 [Next Generation Update]
