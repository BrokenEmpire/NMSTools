# NMSTools

A .net serialization framework for viewing and saving No Man's Sky save games.  All properties are attributed with the obscured NMS key and all classes inherit INotifyPropertyChanged for easy WPF/XAML binding.

The framework uses Newtonsoft.Json for Json parsing.

Save file schema is based on No Man's Sky version 3.13 [Next Generation Update]

The project is currently undergoing active development and is not ready for public use.
